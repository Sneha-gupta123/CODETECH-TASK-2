# Student Grade Manager

A Python-based program to track and manage student grades for different subjects or assignments.

It also includes error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Features

- **Calculate Average**: Automatically compute the average of all entered grades.
- **Letter Grade**: Determine the overall letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on the average.
- **GPA Calculation**: Calculate GPA using a 4.0 scale.
- **Error Management**:
  - Validate grade input to ensure it is numeric and within the range of 0â€“100.
  - Prevent duplicate subject entries.
  - Handle cases where no grades are entered.

## Prerequisites
